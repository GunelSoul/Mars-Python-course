You will create a base class called Vehicle which will have common attributes and methods shared by all types of vehicles. Then, you will create child classes that inherit from the Vehicle class, representing different types of vehicles.\n","\n","Your Vehicle class should have the following attributes:\n","\n","make: the make of the vehicle (string)\n","model: the model of the vehicle (string)\n","year: the year the vehicle was made (integer)\n","color: the color of the vehicle (string)\n","mileage: the current mileage of the vehicle (float)\n","Your Vehicle class should also have the following methods:\n","\n","start(): a method that starts the vehicle's engine\n","stop(): a method that stops the vehicle's engine\n","drive(distance): a method that simulates driving the vehicle for a given distance in miles. This method should update the vehicle's mileage attribute.\n","Your child classes should represent different types of vehicles, such as:\n","\n","Car: a vehicle designed for transportation on roads\n","Boat: a vehicle designed for transportation on water\n","Plane: a vehicle designed for transportation in the air\n","Each child class should inherit the attributes and methods of the Vehicle class, but can also have its own additional attributes and methods.\n","\n","For example, the Car class could have an additional attribute called num_passengers and a method called accelerate() that increases the car's speed. The Boat class could have an additional attribute called draft and a method called dock() that allows the boat to safely dock at a harbor. The Plane class could have an additional attribute called max_altitude and a method called takeoff() that allows the plane to take off from a runway.\n","\n","Once you have created your vehicle models, create instances of each type of vehicle and call their methods to showcase their unique features. Have fun and be creative!\n"],"metadata":{"id":"juBTU-cKVFup"}}]}
